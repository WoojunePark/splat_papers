### 2. How This Work Fits into the Broader Research Landscape

Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) is a fundamental technology in fields such as mobile robotics, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR), enabling a vision sensor to estimate its own pose while concurrently reconstructing an environment map. Recent advancements in vSLAM have explored 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, particularly for generating high-fidelity dense maps, which offer superior geometric precision and detail compared to sparse reconstruction.

Historically, many SLAM algorithms, including those utilizing 3DGS, operate under the assumption of a static environment. This assumption often leads to significant performance degradation in dynamic environments, which are common in real-world applications. Challenges arise from the presence of moving objects, which can introduce motion artifacts, corrupt map consistency, and degrade camera pose estimation accuracy.

Traditional dynamic SLAM methods typically rely on single-frame object detection, often coupled with semantic segmentation or optical flow. However, these methods frequently struggle with robustly identifying dynamic objects across all frames due to limitations such as dependence on specific semantic labels (e.g., DynaSLAM), susceptibility to misjudgment in complex motion conditions (e.g., optical flow-based methods like Rodyn-SLAM), or reliance on predefined object categories.

In the context of 3DGS-based SLAM, approaches like MonoGS and Splatam demonstrate effectiveness in static scenes but experience performance drops in dynamic settings. More recent developments have attempted to address dynamics within 3DGS SLAM. DG-SLAM uses depth warping, but its effectiveness is limited by reliance on short-duration neighboring frames. DyPho-SLAM, UP-SLAM, and DGS-SLAM require prior depth information or explicit semantic labels, restricting their generalizability. WildGS-SLAM introduced an uncertainty-aware approach using an MLP supervised by 3DGS rendering loss to identify dynamic regions. However, this method's performance can deteriorate in areas with weak 3DGS reconstruction (e.g., background regions) or when dynamic objects exhibit transiently static behavior, leading to misjudgment.

This research aims to advance the field of dynamic 3DGS SLAM by introducing a generalizable motion model that addresses the limitations of existing methods. It specifically targets the challenge of dynamic object identification without predefined semantic annotations or depth input, moving beyond single-frame analysis to leverage temporal context for more robust dynamic-static separation, thereby enhancing localization and dense mapping in challenging dynamic environments.

### 3. Key Objectives and Motivation

The primary objective of this research is to develop a robust monocular 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM system, named GGD-SLAM, that can operate effectively in dynamic environments without relying on predefined semantic annotations or external depth input. This system aims to achieve accurate camera pose estimation and high-fidelity dense mapping under challenging real-world conditions.

The motivation for this work stems from several critical limitations observed in the broader research landscape of dynamic SLAM:

1.  **Dependence on Static Environment Assumption:** Visual SLAM algorithms, including those leveraging 3DGS for dense mapping, predominantly assume static environments. When confronted with moving objects, these systems exhibit significant performance degradation, leading to inaccurate camera tracking and corrupted map reconstructions characterized by motion artifacts.
2.  **Lack of Robust Dynamic Object Identification:** A significant challenge in dynamic environments is the accurate identification and segregation of dynamic elements from the static background without prior knowledge.
    *   **Semantic Label Requirement:** Many existing dynamic SLAM approaches, such as DyPho-SLAM, necessitate specific predefined semantic labels or depth input to mask out dynamic features. This requirement limits their generalizability and practical applicability in diverse, unconstrained environments where such annotations are unavailable.
    *   **Single-Frame and Per-Scene Limitations:** Current methods often struggle with identifying true object motion. Single-frame analysis can only provide static attributes (contour, shape, texture) but lacks explicit motion information. Approaches like WildGS-SLAM, which use an uncertainty-aware MLP, heavily depend on the quality of per-scene 3DGS rendering. This dependency makes them susceptible to misjudgments in areas with poor 3DGS reconstruction (e.g., background) or when dynamic objects are temporarily stationary (e.g., a person pausing), leading to degraded reconstruction quality.
3.  **Absence of Temporal Context for Motion:** The intrinsic nature of motion is defined by positional changes over a sequence of frames. Existing methods often neglect this temporal aspect, relying on instantaneous observations or short-term optical flow, which can lead to misclassifications and insufficient robustness in complex dynamic scenarios.

To mitigate these issues, the authors propose a core insight: accurate dynamic object identification necessitates the incorporation of temporal context and correlation across multiple consecutive frames.

Based on this, the specific objectives and strategies articulated in the paper are:
*   To design a **Generalizable Motion Model (GMM)** that can extract dynamic semantic features from progressive SLAM inputs (image sequences) without requiring predefined semantic annotations or depth information, thereby serving as a robust prior for 3DGS SLAM systems.
*   To implement a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue structure** to manage incoming frames, facilitating dynamic feature extraction via a sequential attention mechanism that considers historical context.
*   To integrate a **dynamic feature enhancer** to effectively separate static and dynamic components from the extracted features.
*   To devise a strategy for **filling occluded areas** by sampling static information from a constructed KD-tree of static Gaussians, preserving background consistency and mitigating artifacts from dynamic object removal.
*   To design a **distractor-adaptive Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss** specifically tailored for dynamic environments to minimize the impact of dynamic distractors on the optimization of static scene components.
*   To integrate the generalizable motion model with an **uncertainty-aware approach** in the mapping process, reducing dynamic object misjudgment caused by sole reliance on 3DGS rendering errors.

By achieving these objectives, GGD-SLAM aims to provide precise camera tracking and high-fidelity dense mapping capabilities, making it more applicable to real-world mobile robotics, AR, and VR systems operating in dynamic environments.

### 4. Methodology and Approach

GGD-SLAM is a monocular 3DGS SLAM framework designed for dynamic environments. Its architecture is divided into three interconnected modules: a Generalized Motion Model (GMM), a Tracking module, and a Mapping module. The system aims to estimate camera poses and update 3D Gaussian parameters given an input image sequence.

#### 4.1. Generalized Motion Model (GMM)

The GMM is a core contribution designed to extract dynamic semantics from image sequences, providing a generalizable prior without per-scene online training.

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   An input image $I_t$ is processed by a pre-trained DINOv2 feature extractor to obtain image features $x_t$.
    *   A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue $Q_t$ stores features from the last $L$ frames ($x_{t-L}$ to $x_{t-1}$). For initial frames where $Q_t$ is not full, zero-padding is applied to maintain temporal consistency. This queue provides temporal context for motion inference.

2.  **Sequential Attention Mechanism:**
    *   The current frame's features $x_t$ are transformed into a query vector $Q_t$.
    *   The historical features in $Q_t$ are transformed into key vectors $K_t$ and value vectors $V_t$.
    *   A Multi-Head Attention mechanism computes $F_{attn,t}$, which encapsulates temporally-enhanced features.
    *   $F_{attn,t}$ is then processed by a dynamic head and a static head to obtain an enhancement coefficient $D$ for dynamic attributes and a suppression coefficient $S$ for static components.
    *   These are fused with $F_{attn,t}$ using a gated attention mechanism: $F_{enh,t} = F_{attn,t} \odot (1 + \alpha D) \odot (1 - \alpha S)$, where $\odot$ is the Hadamard product and $\alpha$ is a learnable balancing coefficient.
    *   The enhanced feature $F_{enh,t}$ is fused with the original structural features $x_t$ and fed into a feedforward network to produce a raw probability map $\hat{M}_{raw,t}$.
    *   Bilinear interpolation converts $\hat{M}_{raw,t}$ into a full-resolution probability map $\hat{M}_t$, where pixel values indicate the probability of moving semantics.

3.  **Training and Inference:**
    *   **Training:** The GMM is trained with a supervised loss function $L_{GD}$, comprising a pixel-wise absolute difference $L_{base}$, a binary entropy penalty $L_{reg}$ to drive predictions towards {0, 1}, and a Dice loss $L_{dice}$ to preserve structural integrity. The model is trained on the Davis Dataset which provides ground-truth motion masks.
    *   **Inference:** After training, Otsu's adaptive thresholding is applied to $\hat{M}_t$ to binarize it into a raw mask $M_{raw,t}$. Morphological dilation with a disk-shaped structuring element $K_r$ refines the edges, yielding the final binary motion prior mask $M_t$.

#### 4.2. Tracking Progress

The tracking module estimates camera poses by adapting DROID-SLAM's dense bundle adjustment (DBA) framework.

1.  **Depth Estimation:** Scale-aware monocular depth estimates $D_{est}$ are obtained using Metric3D-v2, which offers zero-shot generalization.
2.  **Pose Optimization:** DBA operates on a frame graph $G=(V, E)$ of keyframes. The objective is to optimize camera poses $T$ and estimate monocular depth maps $d$.
3.  **Dynamic Region Exclusion:** The crucial adaptation for dynamic environments is the incorporation of the GMM-generated dynamic prior $M_t$. The static component $S_t = 1 - M_t$ is used to proactively set residual weights to zero in dynamic regions during optimization. This avoids incorrect factor graph construction caused by dynamic points, enhancing computational efficiency and robustness.
4.  **Loss Function:** The tracking loss (Equation 6) includes terms for monocular pose estimation (with dynamic regions masked by $S_t$), a depth supervision loss leveraging neural depth predictions, and a trajectory smoothness regularization term to penalize abrupt pose variations.

#### 4.3. Mapping Progress

The mapping module updates the 3D Gaussian map for dense scene reconstruction.

1.  **GMM Guided Uncertainty:**
    *   Building upon an uncertainty-aware framework, a shallow MLP $P$ predicts an uncertainty map $U_t$ from the image features $x_t$.
    *   To address dynamic misjudgment issues associated with solely relying on per-scene 3DGS rendering loss, the GMM's temporal prior $M_t$ is integrated into the uncertainty loss $L_{uncer}$.
    *   $L_{uncer}$ (Equation 7) comprises a 3DGS reconstruction error $L_{3DGS}$, a prior loss $L_{prior}$ that penalizes high uncertainty in dynamic regions identified by $M_t$, and a regularization term $L_{reg\_U}$ to constrain uncertainty magnitudes.

2.  **Incremental Gaussian Map:**
    *   Upon observing a new keyframe, new Gaussians are incrementally created for newly observed static feature points. Each new Gaussian is initialized with the pixel's color, unprojected location, an opacity of 0.5, and a radius of 0.1.
    *   **Occlusion Recovery:** When new frames contain dynamic objects, the system addresses occluded static areas. A KD-tree is constructed for the 2D projected locations of static Gaussians. For dynamic points, their k-nearest static Gaussian neighbors are queried, and random sampling within this neighborhood is used to replace the depth and color attributes of dynamic points with those of static ones. This aims to preserve geometric continuity in occluded regions.
    *   Scale expansion and opacity enhancement are applied to these recovered occluded points to prevent sparsification and optimization inefficiency.

3.  **Gaussian Update:**
    *   3D Gaussians are sorted by view depth and alpha-blended to render RGB images ($I_r$) and depth maps ($D_r$).
    *   Gaussian parameters are iteratively optimized via gradient descent using a mapping loss $L_{mapping}$ (Equation 11).
    *   **$L_{3DGS}$:** This term quantifies the reconstruction error between the rendered image/depth and the ground-truth inputs, with the error weighted by the uncertainty map. It includes both RGB and depth residuals.
    *   **$L_{iso}$:** An isolation regularization term is applied to scaling parameters to suppress artifacts in sparsely observed regions.
    *   **Distractor-Adaptive SSIM Loss ($L_{ssim\_dy}$):** Conventional SSIM can be polluted by dynamic distractors even if they are masked post-computation. To counter this, a novel approach is introduced (Fig. 3). The prior static component $S_t$ is convolved with a unit kernel to generate an "adapted kernel" $w_{ad}$ and a count of valid static pixels $N_{ad}$. This adapted kernel is then used in SSIM calculation (Equation 13a) and normalized, ensuring that SSIM loss is computed only for pure static regions, thereby avoiding the introduction of inaccurate loss from dynamic areas.

### 5. Main Findings and Results

The efficacy of GGD-SLAM was evaluated on various challenging real-world dynamic datasets, including TUM RGB-D, Bonn RGB-D Dynamic, and Wild-SLAM. The generalizable motion model was trained on the Davis Dataset. Performance was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Standard Deviation (Std.) of Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) for tracking, and PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS for reconstruction quality in static regions.

#### 5.1. Evaluation of Tracking

1.  **Generalizable Motion Model (GMM) Qualitative Performance:** Visualizations (Fig. 4) demonstrate that the GMM effectively extracts dynamic object semantics by leveraging historical frames. It outperforms single-image semantic segmentation methods (e.g., Yolo+SAM), which struggle with small targets, blurry fast-moving objects, and large camera movements. The GMM also addresses misjudgment issues of uncertainty-aware methods (like WildGS-SLAM) in background regions or when objects are transiently static. For instance, the GMM accurately classified a chair as dynamic in the 800th frame of `fr3/w/half` because its long-term historical observations indicated movement, even if it was instantaneously static. Using only base loss for pixel-wise learning was shown to result in significant noise, underscoring the benefits of the complete GMM.

2.  **Quantitative Tracking Results (Table I):**
    *   GGD-SLAM achieves competitive and often superior camera tracking performance (lower ATE and Std) compared to state-of-the-art dynamic dense SLAM approaches.
    *   It demonstrates performance comparable to or better than some RGB-D-based methods (e.g., RoDyn-SLAM, DyPho-SLAM) in certain highly dynamic sequences (e.g., `fr3/w/half`, `bonn/crowd2`), despite being a monocular system. This is attributed to the GMM's precise dynamic distractor recognition which reduces incorrect data associations.
    *   GGD-SLAM significantly outperforms other monocular 3DGS SLAM systems like Splatam, MonoGS, and WildGS-SLAM, which lack a sufficiently robust dynamic object handling mechanism.

3.  **Ablation Study on Tracking (Table II):** An ablation study on the Bonn RGB-D Dynamic Dataset confirmed the contribution of key components. The "Generalizable Prior" (from GMM), "OTSU Binarize" (for ambiguous edges), and "Smoothness" (regularization term in tracking) all contribute to the robustness of the tracking module, with the full model achieving the best performance (e.g., 3.41 ATE on `ps track`, 1.79 ATE on `crowd2`).

#### 5.2. Evaluation of Mapping

1.  **Qualitative Mapping Results (Fig. 5):**
    *   Qualitative comparisons illustrate that DG-SLAM and DyPho-SLAM rely on semantic labels and depth input.
    *   MonoGS and Splatam exhibit severe performance degradation and artifacts under dynamic interference.
    *   WildGS-SLAM, while an improvement, shows poor background rendering after large camera movements and inadequate removal of occlusions, leading to residual artifacts, primarily due to its reliance on 3DGS rendering quality for dynamic object misjudgment.
    *   In contrast, GGD-SLAM effectively eliminates dynamic interference while maintaining high-quality background rendering, producing visually cleaner and more consistent reconstructions.

2.  **Quantitative Mapping Results (Table III):**
    *   GGD-SLAM achieves the best performance among monocular GS-based frameworks on the dynamic sequences of TUM and Bonn datasets for dense map reconstruction.
    *   It consistently records higher PSNR and SSIM values and lower LPIPS scores across all evaluated sequences (e.g., average PSNR 23.03, SSIM 0.859, LPIPS 0.158), indicating superior photorealistic reconstruction quality compared to MonoGS, Splatam, and WildGS-SLAM.

3.  **Ablation Study on Mapping (Table IV):** An ablation study on the mapping module demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed components. The combination of "Dynamic SSIM" (distractor-adaptive SSIM loss) and "Static KD-Tree" (for occlusion recovery) yields the highest PSNR values (e.g., 22.68 on `fr3/w/xyz`, 24.27 on `bonn/cr2`), confirming their individual and combined contributions to reconstruction quality.

#### 5.3. More Generalized Scenarios

Evaluation on the Wild-SLAM Dataset (Fig. 6) further demonstrates the generalization capability of the GGD-SLAM's dynamic semantic extraction network. The system successfully segments various types of moving objects (e.g., small ball, racket, umbrella) and effectively guides the uncertainty generation, leading to high-quality rendering. The Wild-SLAM dataset, characterized by higher-resolution imagery and milder camera motion, allows both GGD-SLAM and WildGS-SLAM to achieve high performance due to favorable rendering conditions.

### 6. Significance and Potential Impact

The GGD-SLAM framework represents a notable advancement in the field of monocular 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM, specifically addressing the persistent challenge of operating in dynamic environments. Its significance and potential impact are multifaceted:

1.  **Enhanced Robustness in Dynamic Environments:** The primary impact is the significant improvement in the robustness and accuracy of visual SLAM systems when confronted with dynamic objects. By introducing a generalizable motion model (GMM) that leverages temporal sequences and attention mechanisms, GGD-SLAM effectively distinguishes dynamic from static elements. This overcomes a core limitation of many existing SLAM algorithms that degrade in dynamic settings.
2.  **Reduced Dependency on External Priors:** A key advantage of GGD-SLAM is its independence from predefined semantic annotations or external depth input. This eliminates practical constraints that limit the deployability of other dynamic SLAM systems in diverse, unconstrained real-world scenarios. The monocular input requirement makes it more versatile and cost-effective.
3.  **State-of-the-Art Performance:** The system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both camera pose estimation (tracking) and dense map reconstruction (mapping) within dynamic scenes. Its ability to outperform even some RGB-D based methods in highly dynamic sequences underscores its effectiveness and the robustness of its dynamic handling mechanisms.
4.  **Improved Mapping Fidelity:** The proposed mapping optimization strategies, including the static Gaussian KD-tree for occlusion recovery and the distractor-adaptive SSIM loss, contribute to more consistent and photorealistic reconstruction of the static background. This ensures that the map remains accurate and visually high-quality despite the presence of dynamic distractors.
5.  **Broader Applicability:** The advancements in dynamic handling and the monocular nature of GGD-SLAM make it highly relevant for a range of applications, including:
    *   **Mobile Robotics:** Enabling robots to navigate and understand environments with moving people, vehicles, or other objects more reliably.
    *   **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR):** Facilitating stable tracking and scene understanding in dynamic user environments, crucial for immersive and interactive experiences.
    *   **Autonomous Systems:** Providing more robust environmental perception for self-driving cars, drones, and other autonomous agents.
6.  **Foundation for Future Research:** The paper lays a foundation for further research by identifying clear directions for future work, such as real-time reconstruction of dynamic object motion and inpainting of fully occluded regions. This indicates that while the current system excels in static scene consistency, there is potential to expand its capabilities to fully model and represent dynamic elements themselves, moving beyond mere removal.

In summary, GGD-SLAM significantly pushes the boundaries of monocular 3DGS SLAM in dynamic environments by offering a robust, generalizable, and accurate solution that does not rely on restrictive external priors. Its contributions have the potential to enhance the reliability and applicability of visual SLAM technology across numerous robotic and extended reality domains.
