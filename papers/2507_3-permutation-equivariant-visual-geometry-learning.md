abstract: "We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$ employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any reference frames. This design not only makes our model inherently robust to input ordering, but also leads to higher accuracy and performance. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction. Code and models are available at this https URL."

### **2. How This Work Fits into the Broader Research Landscape**

Visual geometry reconstruction, the process of recovering 3D scene structure from images, is a fundamental problem in computer vision with implications for applications such as augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous navigation. Historically, this challenge was addressed by classical methods like Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS). These techniques rely on establishing feature correspondences and iteratively optimizing 3D structure and camera poses, often through Bundle Adjustment. A characteristic of these traditional approaches is the anchoring of the reconstructed geometry to a designated, fixed reference view, establishing its coordinate system as the global frame of reference.

Recent advancements have seen the emergence of feed-forward neural networks as an alternative. Models such as DUSt3R and its successors (e.g., Fast3R, FLARE, VGGT) have demonstrated the ability of deep learning to directly regress 3D geometry from image inputs, improving speed and scalability compared to iterative classical methods. While these neural network-based approaches offer significant advantages, many of them have inherited the inductive bias of using a fixed reference view for their reconstructions. This paper identifies this persistent reliance on a reference view as a critical limitation.

The work presented in "π^3" (pronounced "Pi-cubed") aims to challenge and overcome this paradigm. It positions itself as a departure from both classical and many contemporary feed-forward methods by proposing a fundamentally different approach that entirely eliminates the need for a designated reference frame. By doing so, it seeks to address the robustness and performance limitations observed in existing systems that are sensitive to the arbitrary choice of a reference view.

---

### **3. Key Objectives and Motivation**

The central motivation for this research stems from a systematically identified limitation prevalent across both traditional and modern visual geometry reconstruction methods: the reliance on a single, fixed reference view. The authors contend that treating the camera coordinate system of a chosen view as the global frame introduces an "unnecessary inductive bias" that inherently constrains the performance and robustness of feed-forward neural networks.

Empirical evidence presented in the paper supports this contention, demonstrating that state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including VGGT, exhibit considerable sensitivity to the initial view selection. A suboptimal choice of the reference view can lead to a substantial degradation in reconstruction quality. This variability impedes the development of reliable and robust visual geometry systems for real-world applications.

To address this, the primary objective of "π^3" is to introduce a novel, feed-forward neural network architecture that offers a robust, accurate, and fully permutation-equivariant approach to visual geometry reconstruction, thereby breaking the reliance on a conventional fixed reference view.

Specific objectives include:
*   **Eliminate Reference View Bias:** To design a system that does not require designating any input image as a reference frame, thereby removing the associated inductive bias.
*   **Achieve Permutation Equivariance:** To develop an architecture where the output geometry is invariant to the arbitrary ordering of input views, ensuring consistent and stable reconstructions regardless of input sequence.
*   **Predict Affine-Invariant Camera Poses:** To estimate camera poses that are defined up to an arbitrary similarity transformation, without anchoring to a global coordinate system.
*   **Predict Scale-Invariant Local Point Maps:** To generate pixel-aligned 3D point maps for each view, defined within its own camera coordinate system, with consistent scale across a scene.
*   **Improve Robustness and Accuracy:** To demonstrate that by removing the reference view dependency, the proposed method can achieve higher accuracy and greater robustness to input variations compared to existing methods.
*   **Versatile Input Handling:** To enable the model to process diverse inputs, including single images, video sequences, or unordered image sets from both static and dynamic scenes.

### **4. Methodology and Approach**

The proposed "π^3" model is engineered around the principle of permutation equivariance, aiming to eliminate the dependency on a fixed reference view.

**4.1 Permutation-Equivariant Architecture**
The network `ϕ` processes a sequence of N input images `S = (I_1, ..., I_N)` and outputs a corresponding tuple of sequences: `((T_1, ..., T_N), (X_1, ..., X_N), (C_1, ..., C_N))`. Here, `T_i` represents the camera pose, `X_i` is the pixel-aligned 3D point map in its own camera coordinate system, and `C_i` is the confidence map for `X_i`, all corresponding to input image `I_i`.
The key property is `ϕ(P_π(S)) = P_π(ϕ(S))`, where `P_π` is a permutation operator. This ensures that any reordering of input images results in an identically permuted output tuple, guaranteeing a consistent one-to-one mapping between each input image and its associated geometric output.
To achieve this, the architecture explicitly omits order-dependent components. This includes the removal of positional embeddings typically used to differentiate frames and specialized learnable tokens often employed to designate a reference view (e.g., camera tokens in VGGT). The pipeline utilizes a DINOv2 backbone for embedding each view into a sequence of patch tokens. These tokens are then processed through a series of alternating view-wise and global self-attention layers, similar in concept to VGGT, before being fed into a final decoder for output generation. The alternating attention module in `π^3` uses 36 layers.

**4.2 Scale-Invariant Local Geometry**
For each input image `I_i`, the network predicts a pixel-aligned 3D point map `ˆX_i`. Each point cloud is initially defined in its specific local camera coordinate system. Recognizing the inherent scale ambiguity in monocular and multi-view reconstruction, the network is designed to predict point clouds that share an unknown but consistent scale factor across all images within a given scene.
During training, the predicted point maps `(ˆX_1, ..., ˆX_N)` are aligned with their corresponding ground-truth (GT) `(X_1, ..., X_N)` by determining a single optimal scale factor, `s*`. This `s*` minimizes the depth-weighted L1 distance across the entire image sequence, using the ROE solver.
The point cloud reconstruction loss, `L_points`, is then calculated using this optimal scale factor: `L_points = (1 / 3NHW) Σ_i Σ_j (1/z_i,j) ||s*ˆx_i,j - x_i,j||_1`.
Additionally, a normal loss, `L_normal`, is applied to encourage local surface smoothness. This loss minimizes the angle between predicted normal vectors (computed from adjacent points in `ˆX_i`) and their ground-truth counterparts.
A Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss, `L_conf`, supervises the predicted confidence map `C_i`, where ground-truth confidence is 1 if the L1 reconstruction error (scaled by `1/z_i,j`) is below a threshold `ϵ`, and 0 otherwise.

**4.3 Affine-Invariant Camera Pose**
Due to the model's permutation equivariance and the scale ambiguity of multi-view reconstruction, the output camera poses `(ˆT_1, ..., ˆT_N)` are inherently defined only up to an arbitrary similarity transformation (a rigid transformation combined with a global scale factor).
To resolve this, the network is supervised on the *relative poses* between views. The predicted relative pose from view `j` to view `i` is computed as `ˆT_i←j = ˆT_i^-1 ˆT_j`. While relative rotations are invariant to the global transformation, relative translations are not. The optimal scale factor `s*`, previously determined during point map alignment, is leveraged to rectify all predicted camera translations, enabling direct supervision of both rotation and correctly-scaled translation components.
The camera loss, `L_cam`, is a weighted sum of rotation and translation losses, averaged over all ordered view pairs `i≠j`: `L_cam = (1 / N(N-1)) Σ_i≠j (L_rot(i, j) + λ_trans L_trans(i, j))`.
The rotation loss, `L_rot`, minimizes the geodesic distance (angle) between predicted `ˆR_i←j` and ground-truth `R_i←j`. For translation, a Huber loss, `H_δ`, is applied to `(s*ˆt_i←j - t_i←j)` for robustness to outliers. The authors note that this reference-free formulation is suited to capturing the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of camera trajectories.

**4.4 Model Training**
The "π^3" model is trained end-to-end by minimizing a composite loss function `L = L_points + λ_normal L_normal + λ_conf L_conf + λ_cam L_cam`, with `λ`s as hyperparameters.
Training is conducted in two stages:
1.  Initial training at a low resolution (224 × 224 pixels).
2.  Fine-tuning on images with random resolutions (total pixel count between 100,000 and 255,000, aspect ratio [0.5, 2.0]).
The model is trained on a large aggregation of 15 diverse datasets, covering indoor and outdoor environments, synthetic and real-world captures, to ensure robustness and wide applicability. These include GTA-SfM, CO3D, WildRGB-D, Habitat, ARKitScenes, TartanAir, ScanNet, ScanNet++, BlendedMVG, MatrixCity, MegaDepth, Hypersim, Taskonomy, Mid-Air, and an internal dynamic scene dataset.
For optimization, an initial learning rate of 5 × 10^-5 and a OneCycleLR scheduler with a cosine annealing curve are used. The encoder is frozen during training, and the encoder and alternating attention module are initialized from a pre-trained VGGT model to leverage large-scale data priors. The confidence head is trained separately in a final rapid convergence stage.

### **5. Main Findings and Results**

The evaluation of `π^3` was conducted across multiple benchmarks and tasks, consistently demonstrating its performance capabilities compared to existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods.

**5.1 Camera Pose Estimation**
Evaluated using angular accuracy metrics (Relative Rotation Accuracy (RRA), Relative Translation Accuracy (RTA), Area Under Curve (AUC)) on RealEstate10K and Co3Dv2, and distance error metrics (Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE), Relative Pose Error for translation (RPE-t), Relative Pose Error for rotation (RPE-r)) on Sintel, TUM-dynamics, and ScanNet.
*   **SOTA Performance:** `π^3` established new state-of-the-art for zero-shot generalization on Sintel and RealEstate10K. On Sintel, it reduced the ATE from VGGT's 0.167 to 0.074 and RPE-t from 0.062 to 0.040.
*   **Competitive Results:** Achieved competitive SOTA results alongside VGGT on in-domain datasets such as TUM-dynamics, Co3Dv2, and ScanNet.
*   **Tighter Thresholds:** With tighter angular thresholds (e.g., 1°, 3°, 5°) on RealEstate10K, `π^3` maintained robust and consistent performance, outperforming other methods across RRA, RTA, and AUC metrics.

**5.2 Point Map Estimation**
Assessed on scene-level datasets (7-Scenes, NRGBD) under sparse and dense view conditions, and object-centric (DTU) and scene-level (ETH3D) datasets. Metrics included Accuracy (Acc.), Completion (Comp.), and Normal Consistency (N.C.), after alignment using Umeyama and ICP. Chamfer Distance (CD) was also reported.
*   **Strong Generalization:** The method demonstrated robust performance across synthetic/real-world scenarios and sparse/dense view settings.
*   **SOTA on Key Datasets:** `π^3` achieved state-of-the-art results on NRGBD (both sparse and dense), DTU, and ETH3D. For instance, on ETH3D, its mean Accuracy was 0.194 (compared to VGGT's 0.280), and mean Completion was 0.210 (compared to VGGT's 0.305). Its Chamfer Distance metrics were generally lower (better) than competitors.
*   **Qualitative Results:** Visual comparisons indicated that `π^3` produced cleaner, more accurate, and more complete reconstructions with fewer artifacts, even in challenging "in-the-wild" sequences with dynamic and complex static scenes.

**5.3 Depth Estimation**
Evaluated for video depth and monocular depth estimation using Absolute Relative Error (Abs Rel) and prediction accuracy at δ < 1.25, on Sintel, Bonn, KITTI, and NYU-v2.
*   **Video Depth Estimation:** `π^3` achieved new SOTA performance across Sintel, Bonn, and KITTI. On Sintel, it improved Abs Rel from VGGT's 0.299 to 0.233 and δ < 1.25 from 0.638 to 0.664. On KITTI, it achieved Abs Rel of 0.038 (VGGT 0.062) and δ < 1.25 of 0.986 (VGGT 0.969).
*   **Efficiency:** Despite its performance, `π^3` maintained high inference speed, achieving 57.4 FPS on KITTI, surpassing VGGT (43.2 FPS) and Aether (6.14 FPS).
*   **Monocular Depth Estimation:** Achieved state-of-the-art among multi-frame feed-forward approaches and showed competitive performance with specialized monocular depth estimation models like MoGe and Depth Anything V2, despite not being explicitly optimized for single-frame tasks.

**5.4 Robustness Evaluation**
A critical claim of `π^3` is its permutation equivariance. This was empirically validated by permuting input image sequence orders on DTU and ETH3D datasets and measuring the standard deviation of reconstruction metrics.
*   **Near-Zero Variance:** `π^3` exhibited near-zero standard deviation across all metrics on both DTU and ETH3D. For example, on DTU, its mean accuracy standard deviation was 0.003, compared to VGGT's 0.033. On ETH3D, the variance was effectively zero.
*   **Superior Robustness:** This demonstrated that `π^3` is robust to input order variations, contrasting significantly with reference-frame-dependent methods that showed considerable sensitivity.

**5.5 Ablation Study**
An ablation study confirmed the contribution of key components:
*   **Scale-Invariant Point Map Modeling:** This component yielded significant performance improvements on outdoor datasets (e.g., ETH3D), consistent with observations that outdoor scenes are more affected by scale ambiguity. Its impact was less pronounced on indoor datasets.
*   **Affine-Invariant Camera Pose Modeling:** This component consistently enhanced the final performance across all datasets. Crucially, its inclusion rendered the model fully permutation-equivariant, providing robustness to both input frame order and reference view selection.

**5.6 Comparison with VGGT (trained from scratch)**
An experiment demonstrated that when trained from scratch using an auxiliary global pointmap proxy (to stabilize optimization), `π^3` significantly outperformed the VGGT baseline on ETH3D and NRGB benchmarks. This suggests inherent architectural advantages even without leveraging VGGT's pre-trained weights for initialization.

### **6. Significance and Potential Impact**

This work significantly contributes to the field of visual geometry reconstruction by systematically identifying and challenging a fundamental inductive bias present in both traditional and many modern feed-forward methods: the reliance on a fixed reference view. By demonstrating that this dependency limits robustness and performance, the research provides a critical insight that can influence future model designs.

The introduction of `π^3`, a novel, fully permutation-equivariant architecture, represents a methodological advancement. Its ability to predict affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps in a relative, per-view manner, without the need for a global coordinate system or a designated reference frame, addresses a key limitation of existing approaches. This design choice fundamentally enhances the model's stability and consistency.

The reported results underscore the significance of `π^3`. Achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of tasks—including camera pose estimation, multi-view point map reconstruction, and monocular/video depth estimation—while simultaneously demonstrating significantly improved robustness to input ordering, validates the proposed design principles. The model's efficiency, maintaining high inference speeds despite its accuracy, further broadens its practical applicability.

The broader impact of `π^3` lies in its demonstration that "reference-free systems are not only viable but can lead to more stable and versatile 3D vision models." This paradigm shift has the potential to foster the development of more robust and generalizable 3D perception systems. Such systems could be particularly beneficial for real-world applications where varying input conditions, dynamic environments, or arbitrary image collections are common, such as in augmented reality, autonomous navigation, and robotic perception, by minimizing errors caused by arbitrary reference frame choices. While the model currently has limitations (e.g., handling transparent objects, fine-grained detail compared to diffusion models, potential grid-like artifacts), its core contribution represents a notable step forward in building more robust and adaptable 3D vision technologies.
